"""Epoch-close pruning pass.

After equilibration, many sub-claims will have settled at near-zero
net_score and stayed there across rounds. Those nodes are dead weight:
they don't carry standing, they don't move, and every future
equilibration round still walks them. Pruning sweeps them away so the
tendency's tree stays focused on what's actually contested or
supported.

The rule:

  A subtree (rooted at a non-root node N) may be pruned when, over the
  observed score history, BOTH:
    - max(abs(net_score)) < score_threshold     (no standing)
    - max(abs(score change between adjacent     (no surprise/activity)
       checkpoints)) < novelty_threshold

The whole subtree under N is removed -- if N's voice never carried,
neither did anything beneath it.

ROOTs are sacred: every tendency keeps its founding claim regardless.

Pruning is idempotent: calling it twice in a row with no new activity
between calls prunes nothing the second time, because the nodes are
already gone.

Determinism: the function visits nodes in a fixed traversal order
(parent before children, pro-children before con-children, in the
order they currently sit in the parent's lists). Given identical
inputs, two callers produce identical pruned-id lists.
