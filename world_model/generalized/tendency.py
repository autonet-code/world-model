"""GeneralizedTendency: thesis + budget + frame + tree + behaviour.

A tendency in the generalized model is a *thesis about its world* and
the disposition to keep that thesis satisfied. Concretely:

  - It owns a tree (from world_model.models.tree.Tree). The root of the
    tree is the tendency's foundational claim.
  - It owns a CoordinateFrame whose claims correspond to the nodes of
    its tree (one CoordinateClaim per Node, at the same depth, with
    the node's stake aggregated as the claim's stake).
  - It has a budget (real-valued) that it can spend staking on its own
    tree (defense) or on other tendencies' trees (support if PRO,
    attack if CON).
  - It has a CoordinateProbe to evaluate novelty of incoming
    observations and of other tendencies' nodes.

When asked to act, a tendency:
  1. Runs the novelty probe on each incoming observation against its
     own frame.
  2. Based on the termination, stakes on the appropriate node:
       - INTEGRATED    -> stake PRO on the related claim's node, absorb
       - CONTRADICTS   -> stake CON on the contradicted node
       - DISRUPTS      -> stake CON heavily; consider sprouting child
       - ORTHOGONAL    -> ignore (out of this tendency's scope)
       - MAX_ITERATIONS -> ignore for now
  3. For every other tendency in the world, runs the probe on each of
     that tendency's nodes against its own frame. Same staking logic
     but cross-staked into the other's tree.

The tendency doesn't reason about budget allocation between defense
and cross-staking explicitly; the novelty probe's output (which
tendency's tree it's evaluating against) determines where stake
lands. Budget is a hard cap: if the sum of intended stakes exceeds
budget, they're scaled down proportionally.
